1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

When I interpret user needs, I really try to put myself in their shoes. I think about what they would want from the program and why it matters to them. It's like I'm trying to solve a puzzle where the pieces are the different things users want. To make sure I don’t miss anything, I often talk directly to users or gather feedback from them. Then, I break down their needs into specific features or functionalities that I can work on.

Creating “user stories” helps a lot with this because it turns those user needs into clear, actionable tasks. A user story is basically a simple statement that describes what the user wants and why they want it, like "As a user, I want to be able to reset my password so that I can access my account if I forget it." By using user stories, I make sure that every part of the program I build has a purpose and directly relates to what the user needs. It also keeps me focused on making the program user-friendly and useful.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When I develop programs, I like to break down the work into smaller, manageable pieces. This way, I can focus on one thing at a time and make sure it works well before moving on to the next part. I also prefer to get feedback early and often, so I can make adjustments if something isn’t quite right. This approach helps me stay organized and reduces the chances of getting overwhelmed.

In terms of Agile processes, I’m really interested in incorporating practices like Scrum and Continuous Integration into my future development work. With Scrum, I can work in short cycles called sprints, which helps me deliver small but functional parts of the program regularly. This not only keeps the project moving forward but also allows me to get feedback from users or stakeholders more frequently. Continuous Integration, on the other hand, ensures that the code I write is automatically tested and integrated with the existing codebase, reducing the risk of bugs and making the development process smoother. Overall, these Agile processes help me stay flexible and responsive to changes, which is crucial in software development.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development, to me, means being reliable, communicative, and supportive. I think it's important to do my part on time and to the best of my ability because the rest of the team is counting on me. But it's not just about getting my work done; it’s also about being open to helping others when they need it. Whether it's reviewing someone else's code, helping troubleshoot an issue, or just offering a different perspective, I try to contribute wherever I can.

Communication is also key. I make sure to keep my team updated on my progress, especially if I hit any roadblocks that could affect the project timeline. This way, we can work together to find solutions and keep things moving forward. Lastly, I think being respectful and understanding goes a long way. Everyone has different strengths and weaknesses, and part of being a good team member is recognizing that and supporting each other in achieving our common goals.
